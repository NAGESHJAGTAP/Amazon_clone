# Amazon Clone

## Overview
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon website, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It mimics the layout and design of Amazon's homepage, including a responsive navbar, hero section, product categories, and a footer. The project uses low-resolution images sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to ensure fast loading times while maintaining visual appeal.

## Features
- **Navbar**: Includes a logo, delivery address, search bar, language selector, sign-in section, returns/orders, and cart.
- **Panel**: A secondary navigation bar with links like "Today's Deals," "Customer Service," etc.
- **Hero Section**: Displays a background image with a clickable message linking to Amazon India.
- **Shop Section**: Features eight product category boxes (e.g., "Player's Paradise," "Deals in PCs") with images and "See more" links.
- **Products Slider**: A horizontally scrollable section showcasing "Best Sellers in Sports & Outdoors" with product images.
- **Footer**: Contains multiple panels with links for "Get to Know Us," "Make Money with Us," payment options, and help resources.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, including flexbox for responsiveness.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for location, search, cart, and menu.
- **Pexels Images**: Low-resolution images for fast loading (e.g., `w=600` for shop section, `w=300` for slider).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git
   cd amazon-clone
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the site locally.
   - Ensure you have an internet connection, as images are loaded from Pexels CDN.

3. **File Structure**:
   ```
   amazon-clone/
   ├── index.html         # Main HTML file
   ├── AmazonClone.css    # CSS stylesheet
   ├── README.md          # Project documentation
   └── screenshots/       # (Optional) Folder for screenshots
   ```

## Image Sources
All images are sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) with the following specifications:
- **Logo**: `https://images.pexels.com/photos/267394/pexels-photo-267394.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1`
- **Hero Section**: `https://images.pexels.com/photos/5632371/pexels-photo-5632371.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600`
- **Shop Section**: Images with `w=600` (e.g., `https://images.pexels.com/photos/163077/mario-yoshi-toad-nintendo-163077.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600`).
- **Products Slider**: Images with `w=300` (e.g., `https://images.pexels.com/photos/2526878/pexels-photo-2526878.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=300`).

These low-resolution images are optimized for web performance while maintaining decent quality, thanks to CSS scaling (`background-size: cover`, `object-fit: cover`).

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the clone.
- The site is static and does not include backend functionality (e.g., search, cart operations).
- Customize the CSS in `AmazonClone.css` to tweak styles or add responsiveness with media queries.

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript for interactive features (e.g., search functionality, carousel slider).
- Implement media queries for full responsiveness on mobile devices.
- Integrate a backend (e.g., Node.js, Express) for dynamic product data.
